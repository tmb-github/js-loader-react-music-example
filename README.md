# js-loader-react-music-example
JS Loader -- more advanced example loading React and Babel with sample usage

This is a more complex example of the JS Loader.

It can be viewed/interacted-with live at: https://bmt-systems.com/js-loader-react-music-example/

See `js-loader-jquery-example` in this `bmt-systems` repository for a description of the basic mechanics.

This example loads React.js and Babel.js to create a simple, interactive music stats application.

JSX files are transpiled using Babel.js.

The purpose of this example is to illustrate that the JS Loader as outlined in the `js-loader-jquery-example` is capable of non-trivial, complex JavaScript loadings.

It is therefore a robust method for loading scripts of all types using CSP `strict-dyanamic`, the modern method for ensuring safety for your site's visitors.
